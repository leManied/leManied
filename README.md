Hello there ! I'm Damien, a french canadian who loves coding and learning about techs.
Currently, I'm working as a entrepreneur in the cryptocurrencies field.

I know pretty well Python, CSharp has been my first programming language at 12 so I'm a bit rusty.
The projects on my GitHub are open-source and mainly aimed towards a vision of decentralized web3. 
Even though my company, DTechno, is aiming to be profitable, we have a vision of business different of mainstream big tech.
Our goal is to create web services with a brand new vision : user-owner
You can learn more about that on our website : https://www.dtechno.ca/vision
