Hello dear ! I'm Manied, a french canadian who loves coding and learning about techs.
Currently, i know only few things about coding.

I'm mainly learning Python, but I know also basics about CSharp.
  The projects in my GitHub will be only for "backup". If you want to take them and modify them, you can !
  My little projects will be Open-Source, so if someone see something to do or something that helps, take what do you want.
  
Python is love, Python is life
